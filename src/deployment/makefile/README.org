* Introduction

  This target generates a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction][Makefile]] which builds, installs or tests the specified projects on the local machine without employing a CI Server or CI Service.
  The generated Makefile has a rule for each project and dependencies between projects are expressed as dependencies between rules.
  The build can be parallelized by invoking =make= with ~make -j NUMBER-OF-PROCESSES â€¦~.

* Noteworthy Technical Details

** TODO Stamps

   The generated Makefile writes "stamp" files to track already finished work.
   This allows resuming incomplete builds but also means that certain changes such as source code changes in project repositories are not picked up.

** TODO Name Mangling

** ONESHELL

   We emit

   #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /bin/bash
     .SHELLFLAGS = -ec
   #+END_SRC

   at the top of the Makefile.
   This causes =make= to invoke the shell such that it executes the recipe lines of each rule as a single chunk instead of one shell invocation per line (or multiple continuation lines using "\").
   Note that we have to pass =-c= to the shell so it doesn't attempt to execute the shell code chunk as a command.

** TODO Parallel Execution and Nested =make= Invocations
