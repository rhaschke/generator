* Introduction

  When this target is used, the generator directly builds the specified projects on the local machine without generating intermediate build instructions such as Makefiles and without employing a CI server or CI service.
  Only full builds (as opposed to incremental ones) are supported since the progress of an incomplete build cannot be persisted.
  Dependencies between projects and individual steps within a project are considered.
  Individual steps can be executed in parallel.
